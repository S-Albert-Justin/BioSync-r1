# BioSync R1

This is a **Flutter-based mobile application** that connects with an **ESP32 via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** to receive **heart rate data** from a MAX30102 sensor and **motion data** from an MPU6050 sensor. The app visualizes real-time biometric and movement data.
note: this version does not connect with blutooth. the version which connects with blutooth is private.

## Features  
- üì° **BLE Connectivity**: Connects to ESP32 for real-time data transfer.  
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Displays BPM from MAX30102 sensor.  
- üîÑ **Motion Tracking**: Reads accelerometer and gyroscope data from MPU6050.  
- üìä **Real-time Data Display**: Shows sensor readings dynamically in the app.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Flutter** (UI & App Logic)  
- **Flutter Blue Plus** (BLE communication)  
- **ESP32** (Microcontroller)  
- **MAX30102** (Heart Rate Sensor)  
- **MPU6050** (Accelerometer & Gyroscope)
